# Compare Decisions Systematically

This application supports structured and traceable decision-making using a weighted utility analysis.

Instead of making decisions purely intuitively, alternatives are evaluated systematically based on defined criteria.  
Weighting ensures that personal priorities are properly reflected in the final result.

The application creates transparency, comparability, and an objective decision-making foundation.

## Requirements

A user account is required to create and save analyses.

1. Register  
2. Log in  
3. In the dashboard, select `+ Create Analysis` and get started  

---

## Typical Use Cases

The application is particularly suitable for:

- Purchase decisions (e.g., laptop, car, smartphone)  
- Choosing a holiday or travel destination  
- Comparing service offers (insurance, hosting, subscriptions)  
- Project or supplier selection  
- Strategic or business decisions  

Whenever multiple options need to be evaluated against multiple criteria, utility analysis provides clear added value.

# Example: Selecting a Ski Holiday Destination

Goal: Select the most suitable destination for a winter holiday week.

This example demonstrates the complete workflow of an analysis.

## 1. Create a New Analysis

![Create Analysis](/create-analysis.png)

In the dashboard, click `+ Create Analysis`.

Example:
- Title: `Ski Holiday 2030`
- Description: `Comparison of different ski resorts`

Click `Create Analysis`.

## 2. Define and Weight Criteria

![Define Criteria](/criteria.png)

Criteria define the aspects according to which alternatives are evaluated.  
The weight (whole number) determines the relative importance of each criterion.

Important: The total sum of all weights must equal 100.  
Only if the total weighting equals 100 is the analysis valid and can be calculated.

Example:

| Criterion | Weight |
|------------|--------|
| Price | 20 |
| Snow Reliability | 25 |
| Variety of Slopes | 20 |
| Travel Time | 15 |
| Accommodation Options | 10 |
| Leisure / Après-Ski | 10 |

The higher the weight, the stronger the influence of the criterion on the overall result.

## 3. Add Alternatives

![Add Alternatives](/alternatives.png)

Example destinations:

- Zermatt  
- Davos  
- Engelberg  
- Laax  

Each alternative will later be evaluated individually for every criterion.

---

## 4. Enter Ratings

![Enter Ratings](/ratings.png)

Each alternative is rated per criterion on a scale from 1 to 5:

- 1 = very poor  
- 3 = average  
- 5 = excellent  

Ratings should be assigned in a consistent and as objective a manner as possible.

---

## 5. Analyze the Results

![Result Overview](/result.png)

The application automatically calculates:

Rating × Weight

All weighted contributions are summed and displayed as a total score.  
The ranking shows which alternative performs best according to the defined priorities.

---

## Added Value of the Application

Utility analysis provides several advantages:

- Structured decision-making  
- Transparent prioritization  
- Objective comparability  
- Traceable results  
- Reduction of purely intuitive decisions  

If the result does not match expectations, criteria or weights can be adjusted and the impact can be analyzed immediately.  
This enables an iterative and reflective decision-making process.

## Recommendations for Effective Use

- Avoid too many criteria (3–10 are usually sufficient)  
- Define criteria clearly and precisely  
- Assign weights deliberately  
- Apply ratings consistently  

The application is a decision-support tool – it does not replace personal judgment, but makes it transparent and systematic.
